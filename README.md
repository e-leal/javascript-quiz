Javascript-Quiz, or otherwise known as Javascript Coding Challenge, is an application that test's the user's knowledge of javascript in a timed setting. Once the user confirms tht they are ready to begin (start the quiz), the timer starts counting down from 60 seconds. The user will be prompted with various multiple choice questions, one at a time. A brief message will appear below the question, indicating whether the user has answered the question correctly or not.
    Once either the timer has run out, or if the user has answered all available questions, the user will then be prompted to fill in their initials in order to save their current score in localStorage. 
    After the user has submitted their initials, they are shown the list of saved scores and have either the option to return to the main page before the quiz starts, or to clear the list of high scores.
